## Intro to ARIMA Models
- ARIMA models are one of the most common univariate time series forecasting methods.

--

- ARIMA stands for **A**uto**R**egressive **I**ntegrated **M**oving **A**verage.

--

- We will explore each part of the ARIMA model in detail before moving on to its implementation in R.

## Stationarity
- A time series is said to be *strictly stationary* if the distribution of the observations does not change across time.

--

- However, strict stationarity is not always necessary to model a time series. We often reference *weak stationarity* in our analysis.

--

- $E(y_{t}) = \mu$ (constant mean)

--

- $E[(y_{t} - \mu)(y_{t} - \mu)] = \sigma^2 < \infty$ (constant variance)

--

- $E[(y_{t_{k}} - \mu)(y_{t_{k'}} - \mu)] = \gamma_{t_{k}-t_{k'}} \space \forall \space t_{k}, t_{k'}$ (constant autocovariance)

--
  - When $k = k'$, the autocovariance is the variance.
  
--

- The autocovariance is not particularly useful since it is scale-dependent. Therefore, we often normalize the autocovariance by dividing by the variance.

--

- This is called the *autocorrelation*, and this measure has the usefulness of being bounded between $\pm1$
